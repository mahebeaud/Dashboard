# Dasboard

This is a dashboard with widgets that can be customized to show important information quickly. It has a weather widget to show the current conditions in a selected city, a live views widget to display video feeds from selected locations, a YouTube widget that requires users to log in to access a selected video, and a Subreddit widget that displays recent posts from a selected subreddit, which also requires users to log in.  

Users can add or remove widgets, and choose which city, live view, video, or subreddit to display.  
Although the dashboard is a convenient and efficient way for users to stay informed, some widgets need users to log in to their accounts.

Users have the option to sign in and sign up on the website using OAuth 2.0, in addition to the traditional method.
